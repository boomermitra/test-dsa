/*Antonio got an array A consisting of N integers as his christmas present.
Antonio likes an array if and only if the sum of all elements of that array is odd. Like Antonio likes arrays [4,1,4], [2,2,1] etc. but not arrays [4,4], [2,6,2] etc.
Now to make array A of his likeness he can perform the belows operations on it :

Operation 1:
Remove exactly one element from the array.
Operation 2:
Divide every element of the array by 2.
 
Given array A, print the minimum number of above operations required to make array A of Antonio’s likeness(i.e. To make the sum of all elements of array A odd).

Input Format
First line contains a single integer denoting N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A. 

Output Format
Print the minimum number of above operations required to make array A of Antonio’s likeness(i.e. To make the sum of all elements of array A odd).

Constraints
1<=N<=10^5
1<=Ai<=10^9

Sample Input 1
3
6 4 10

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation of Sample 1
One can perform the operations as :
 
First perform operation 1 and remove the first element of the array. Array A becomes = [4 10].
Then perform the second operation and divide each element of the array by 2. A becomes = [2 5].
Now Antonio likes array [2 5] because the sum of all elements of this array is 7, which is odd. */
