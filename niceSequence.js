/*Question Name: Nice Subsequence

Problem Statement 

Given an array A consisting of N integers. 

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given array by deleting zero or more elements(not all) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A nice subsequence is a subsequence of array A in which the difference between any two elements equals the difference between their original indices in array A.

More formally a subsequence [Ai1 Ai2 Ai3 â€¦ AiL] of array A is nice if for any 1<=p,q<=L, Aip-Aiq = ip-iq holds.

Now you have to find the largest possible length of a nice subsequence of array A.

Input Format
    First line contains a single integer denoting N.
    Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.

Output Format

    Print the largest possible length of a nice subsequence of array A.

Constraints

    1<=N<=105
    1<=Ai<=109

 
Sample Input 1

Sample Output 1

3 

Explanation of Sample 1 

A possible nice subsequence of length 3 is [A1 A3 A6] = [2 4 7] */

function niceSubsequence(arr, n) {}

//Driver Code
var n = readline();
var temp = readline().trim();
var s = temp.split(" ");
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  s[i] = Number(s[i]);
}
var num = niceSubsequence(s, n);
print(num);
